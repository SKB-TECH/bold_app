    "exoViolenceResume1": "Domestic violence is a social problem rooted in historical relationships of inequality between men and women. In fact, in 80% of cases reported to the police, the victims are women. Conjugal violence occurs in couples where both partners have an intimate and affective relationship, and can continue after separation. It involves a relationship of domination in which the aggressor establishes and maintains his hold over his victim, while ensuring that she does not leave him.",
    "exoViolenceResume2": "Domestic violence is a strategic cycle in which the aggressor tries to continually thwart all the victim's reactions in order to keep her under his control. It's a power struggle. It's not a dynamic in which two people take it in turns to be aggressor and victim. It's a series of strategies used by the aggressor to dominate his victim",
